The latest Go release, version 1.3, arrives six months after 1.2, and contains no language changes. It focuses primarily on implementation work, providing precise garbage collection, a major refactoring of the compiler tool chain that results in faster builds, especially for large projects, significant performance improvements across the board, and support for DragonFly BSD, Solaris, Plan 9 and Google's Native Client architecture (NaCl). It also has an important refinement to the memory model regarding synchronization. As always, Go 1.3 keeps the promise of compatibility, and almost everything will continue to compile and run without change when moved to 1.3.

List of changes:

-	supported operating systems and architectures
- 	Changes to the memory model
-	Changes to the implementations and tools
-	Performance
-	Changes to the standard library
